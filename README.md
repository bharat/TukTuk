# TukTuk
This is a simple music player app I wrote for my son, Remy. When he was 2 years old, he'd sit in the back seat of our car and request the same songs over and over again. We got pretty tired of it and wanted to listen to our own music, so it started with a very simple music jukebox and has grown over time.

## Features
1. Music. The main thing that TukTuk does is to let Remy scroll through his songs and play the ones that he wants
2. Movies. After Remy listens to 40 minutes of music, he gets rewarded with a random video! He loves these.
3. MiniGames. Periodically when Remy picks a song, he gets rewarded with a little minigame. Some of them are tiny, some are more complicated. He gets incredibly excited when he gets one of these because when he "wins" the game, he gets a little video reward.

## Demos

## Can you use it?
Absolutely. Even though I designed this for Remy, all the music and videos are backed in the cloud. Not everything is flexible enough to be customized, but if you're interested in creating this experience for your child, contact me and let's make it work!
