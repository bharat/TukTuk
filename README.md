# TukTuk
This is a simple music player app I wrote for my son, Remy. When he was 2 years old, he'd sit in the back seat of our car and request the same songs over and over again. We got pretty tired of it and wanted to listen to our own music, so TukTuk (which is a cute name for "car" in German) started with a very simple music jukebox. We'd give it to him on an iPad with some headphones and he'd happily listen to music for hours.

As of this writing, he's 7 years old and listening to TukTuk is still one of his favorite things to do. Over time we've evolved it with him so it has moments of fun and delight and is personalized for him. But- much of what's there is generalizable so it can be used by other little kids.

## Features
1. Music. The main thing that TukTuk does is to let Remy scroll through his songs and play the ones that he wants
2. Movies. After Remy listens to 40 minutes of music, he gets rewarded with a random video! He loves these.
3. MiniGames. Periodically when Remy picks a song, he gets rewarded with a little minigame. Some of them are tiny, some are more complicated. He gets incredibly excited when he gets one of these because when he "wins" the game, he gets a little video reward.
4. Admin interface. There's a secret interface that's very hard for children to find that enables you to download content from the cloud, cue up minigames, videos, etc.

## Demos
Here are a few quick demos so that you can see what it looks like. To get the full experience, click on a demo image to be taken to a Youtube video which plays the audio as well.

## Can you use it?
Absolutely. Even though I designed this for Remy, all the music and videos are backed in the cloud. Not everything is flexible enough to be customized, but if you're interested in creating this experience for your child, contact me and let's make it work!
